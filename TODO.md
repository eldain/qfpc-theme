Todo Items for QFPC Website: 

- [ ] add ability to go back to categories page after entering an article (no need, browser back button exists for this (except that this makes it harder on the user))
- [ ] change icon spacing on small screens so that there is also margin-bottom for more space underneath the particle physics icon... do this by just adding some space, maybe brs to the bottom of the home page. or apply styling directly to this instance
- [ ] continue styling on the category page and article pages
- [ ] format and style question submission page
- [ ] bump up font in mobile?
- [ ] implement ability to tag articles
