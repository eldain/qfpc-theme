Todo Items for Our QFPC Website:

- [ ] add ability to go back to categories page after entering an article (no need, browser back button exists for this)
- [ ] change icon spacing on small screens so that there is also margin-bottom for more space underneath the particle physics icon... do this by just adding some space, maybe br's to the bottom of the home page. or apply styling directly to this instance
- continue styling on the category page and article pages
- [ ] format and style question submission page
- [ ] bump up font in mobile?
